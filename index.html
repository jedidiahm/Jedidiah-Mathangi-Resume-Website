                <strong>01/2022 - 07/2022</strong><br>
                Designed a programming language and built a compiler for that language. The EML language, which was dynamically typed with simple syntax similar to Python, was created. Tasks included building a lexical analyzer and parser for the compiler.

                The project involved reading about priority queues to implement an SIR epidemic simulation, creating a simple variant of the algorithm, and obtaining infection curves. A priority queue was used to manage the timing of events, the type of event, and the affected node, along with maintaining lists of susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals.
